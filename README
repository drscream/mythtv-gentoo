Information
-----------
This is a gentoo overlay for mythTV. It is only a copy of the other mythTV 
github account [1], that is created because of layman or git doesn't allow
subfolders as overlays.

Instructions
------------
1. Add the url [2] for the mythtv-gentoo-overlay.xml to your layman.cfg file
2. Run layman -Lk to update the layman list of overlays
3. Add the mythtv-gentoo.github.com overlay via layman -a mythtv-gentoo
4. Thats it! If you use eix, run eix-update :-)

Thanks
------
Thanks for kormoc that build all the ebuilds in this repository :-)
